It's fucking absurd, they're practically encouraging it. \n\nThey're like, \"Wow, these redditors are squeezing silver, how cool\" actually fucking encouraging it. \n\nLiterally scum\n\nEdit: Should have mentioned, it's literally fucking impossible to squeeze silver. It's not shorted at all. Hedge funds and Citadel hold lots of Long positions in it, not shorts. Buying it would be playing right into their hands.\n\nBuying silver will make you likely lose money and absolutely give it to the hedge funds and Citadel.\n\nBy Silver, I mean $SLV, *I know nothing about phisical silver*. For anybody confused\n\nEdit 2: If you bought $SLV months or years ago and made a profit, that's fantastic. This post is just saying that you should not buy silver right now.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, I am mentally challenged"

These people are SOLD. Read Canadian news channels regarding the situation, they are much less biased! \n* Google and Apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores, put a calendar reminder in 2-6 weeks to add your review at that time, instead of now.\n\n---\n\n##Let's make a list of the Brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers\n\nThe worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers. This, obviously, affected the stock market, tanked those tickers, and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand.\n\nNow, I'm aware the reasons for this are complicated, we know that for many of them, they were forced to restrict these tickers by their Clearing Houses (Apex being the main one), we don't exactly know why, or whether that is legal or not, however.\n\n**One thing for certain, the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very, very, very bad. This, in turns, significantly harmed the public's trust in them, as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this.**\n\nHere is my list, please comment below and let me know which ones I've missed:\n\n### Horrible Brokers -

The second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses. Currently, the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues:\n\n* Apex Clearing\n* Barclays\n* IKBR\n\nWe don't know if these firms acted maliciously (protecting themselves before protecting the free market), or because they literally had no choice. If the former, they need to be punished. If the later, then laws need to change. EITHER WAY, something needs to change, this post is merely here to put attention on the problem, I don't claim to have the solution.\n\nAdditionally, there needs to be open communication about this issue, currently, they are not saying anything on social media regarding this. Once they do, I'll update this post with it.\n\nNote: /r/ THICC_DICC_PRICC tried to explain this in some detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l90an8/an_explanation_of_what_caused_the_trading_halt/). I cannot attest to the accuracy/validity of his explanation, feel free to discuss that on his post.\n\n---\nWe might keep this information on the sidebar...forever. Please help me build this list to completion. If you are using a broker in the bad list, even if you are not invested in the tickers that have been restricted, please consider moving to a better broker.\n\nThank you all for your patience, we are sorry new members are not able to comment yet, we promise you will be allowed to once this is over!"

I started out with almost zero, and by capitalizing on the stock market frenzy last year, I was able to completely change my life around. I used to think that if I worked hard, did my due diligence, traded smartly, I could make great investments and someday reach the pinnacle of my financial dreams. Something has shifted now. I no longer feel the same way, and I'm not sure if I ever will again.\n\nI wonder if it's naive of me to have thought that the free market was fair. I'm not American so I wasn't aware of the parties involved during the financial crisis in 2008, but it seems that many people are equating what's happening now to back then, calling out the blatant market manipulation in favor of the rich at the expense of the poor.\n\nThey can crash multiple brokerages at the same time, disable purchase of specific stocks instantaneously, manipulate price action in real-time by changing the supply/demand, unleash a short ladder attack on the stock price while the trade volume is being restricted. We've always understood that the media was manipulated, but it was up to us if we wanted to listen. But our direct purchase of stocks, and outright price action manipulation, suddenly it feels very personal.\n\nIt just makes me so sad to know that this hobby of mine that I've enjoyed and come to love so much, is actually controlled by people at the top who can do whatever they want, at any time they want in favor of their own interests. I came into the investing world filled with hope and excitement, and passion for the art of understanding business and capitalizing on opportunities. I'm sad to think that I may never have this outlook again, in light of everything that's been coming out.  Just looking for words of encouragement right now. I love investing and I don't want that joy to be taken from me\n\nEDIT: This is not about money, it's about the integrity of the market.

        "content": "Jumped on the $GME bandwagon on Friday, 4 @ \\~316. My 36 hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out, I will never YOLO on a bubble ever again.\n\nThe principle seemed straightforward: hedge funds got lazy/greedy, over-shorted their positions, bet against a company that wasn't actually going under, and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze. Even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market, the basic premise makes sense. But the devil's in the details, and hype is blinding.\n\nFirst red flag was when I realized [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) did not bet on the short squeeze, he bet on undervalued stock price *over a year ago*. He has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze, he walks away with 8 figures. So the people screaming \"if he's still in, I'm still in!\" and \"look at those brass balls, if he can lose $5MM in a day then I can hold\" are really living up to the dumb ape meme. He didn't lose $5MM yesterday, he lost $5MM in \\*unrealized gains\\*, there is a \\*huge\\* difference.\n\nSecond red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds won't go down without a fight, and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience. You don't get that without learning how to game the system in complex, subtle ways. So even if they are still heavily shorted (which they might not even be anymore), and even if somehow [r/WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/) is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them, that doesn't rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about.\n\nBut even in the off chance that somehow this turns around, and $GME does go \"to the moon,\" that doesn't change the fact that it's bad long-term strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons. They almost certainly fail, and if they don't, they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble. I'm still holding my shares but I don't expect to see my \\~$1200 ever again. In the off chance I break even or see a profit here, I will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains.\n\n**Edit:** holy shit RIP my inbox. No way I can read all that.\n\nWant to clarify a few things. Not financial advice.\n\n**My position:** I knew I was late to the party. I *wanted* to gamble. I knew what I was doing, and (mostly) why I did it. Hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than I wanted to admit, but still, I'm not surprised by the outcome so far, and I'm totally OK with taking the L and calling it a lesson learned. I don't blame DFV, WSB, or anyone for my choices. I own them, even proudly, because I wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs. sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss. I'm holding because I already bought my tickets to this ride, want to see this thing play out, and I'm fine with gambling the final $300 on the outside chance things turn around.\n\n**Your positions:** brothers, sisters, nonbinary siblings: **you are not your portfolio**. whether up or down, your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is. you are a human being on the bleeding edge of 3.5 BILLION years of evolution, you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than you'll ever know. 12 years ago I was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on 211 Steel Reserve. I hit my bottom, joined AA, and now I'm a network engineer, wife, kids, the whole lot. Anything is possible if you don't give up on yourself. But I know it's not that easy, we all need borrowed self-esteem before we can see the real value inside. So if this $GME gamble hit you hard, please reach out to someone. don't give up. Hell, this bubble isn't even over, it might even turn around! But either way, don't give up.\n\n**Edit2:**\n\nwow, never expected this to go this far. wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation. read a ton of replies, probably missed most of them. thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween! A few more points:\n\n* Agreed that RH deserves to be held accountable. No question they manipulated this.\n* Agreed it's not over yet. the squeeze could happen. but if it does, **my** main personal takeaway from this experience will stand: I won't speculate on bubbles anymore. This is my position if I lose everything or make $100k.\n* if you posted gains, that's awesome! so glad for you, I wish you the best!\n\n**Edit3 2/3/21:**\n\nFull disclosure, I closed my position this morning at a \\~$900 realized loss.\n\nMy gut says the squeeze happened, short interest isn't what I thought it was on Friday, and the stock will return to actual value soon.\n\n**Edit4 2/25/21:**\n\n**I stand by my decisions, both to buy and to sell. I don't speculate on bubbles. Period. But you can do whatever the fuck you want with your money and you'll never find me shaming you about it.**"
